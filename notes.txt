TODO:
- focus on modal
- rename type to types
- is my http client global instance?
- window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', function(event)) needed?

Check out:
- abort controller
- environments - dev vs prod

Ask:
- error handling
- app/pages router, the method matters in app?
- request inside request - first client and server - for security and auth
- important header params?
- error in server side?
- class vs object, type


- create separate async fn for promises like in useEffect, need state every time?
